== Basic Info
This project contains the source code (the text) of my book devoted to tests. Codename: '"Bad Tests, Good Test"'.

The main idea of this (short) book, is to present typical issues, bad practices and anti-patterns that I witness frequently when browsing and reviewing test code, and to present how to improve the test code.

You can think about this book as about an additional chapter (very practical and based on real-life issues) of my previous book *Practical Unit Testing with TestNG and Mockito* (see http://practicalunittesting.com).

== It is Free, Yes!
This book is free. I will make it available on my website (in different formats - PDF, ePub, mobi), probably using http://www.paywithatweet.com service. I also think about the printed version, why not?
